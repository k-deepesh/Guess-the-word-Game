### Simple Project Description: Guess The Word Game

This project is a basic word-guessing game built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. Here's what it does:

1. **Random Word Selection**:
   - The game picks a random word from a list.
   - It reveals two letters of the word at the start.

2. **Player Interaction**:
   - Players guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
   - Correct guesses reveal more letters in the word.
   - Players have 6 chances to guess the word correctly.

3. **Game Management**:
   - The game tracks correct guesses and remaining attempts.
   - The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

4. **Web Interface**:
   - The gameâ€™s interface is generated on the server using Thymeleaf templates and displayed in the browser.
